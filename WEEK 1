Week 1: Initial VM Setup and CLI Exploration

After installing Ubuntu on the virtual machine, I used the Linux terminal to explore the system and confirm that the environment was set up correctly.
I created directories and files using commands such as mkdir, touch, and nano, and practiced copying and comparing files using cp, ls -R, and diff. 
These tasks helped verify my understanding of Linux file system structure and basic file operations.

I checked the operating system and kernel information using lsb_release and uname, confirming that the VM is running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS with a stable Linux kernel.
System uptime and load averages were examined using uptime, and the system hostname and network-related information were verified using hostname and related commands.
I also reviewed reboot history with last reboot to observe system restart records.

To verify time and system configuration, I used date, timedatectl, and cal, confirming that the system clock is synchronized via NTP and configured to use the UTC time zone.
Shutdown commands were tested using shutdown with scheduling and cancellation options, demonstrating controlled system power management.

These activities confirmed that the Ubuntu virtual machine is fully operational and correctly configured. 
The commands executed demonstrate foundational Linux administration skills, including file management, system information retrieval, time configuration, and basic system control. T
his provides a solid baseline for future phases involving security configuration, performance testing, and server management.
