After downloading Ubuntu I tried the lab 1 notes to see what will show onto the VM.
These are some of the things it showed.


## Week 2
The lab week 2 was little confusing for me, I have to search why when I execute tree lab_test it doesnt work.
I found that I have to install "sudo apt install tree" and "sudo snap install tree" to be able to print the alpha,betta,gamma.
When I did that it worked, however I found myself into another problem when I run the next steps it shows that "cannot create regular file : not a directory". I double checked everything and I found the mistake I must have put the "betta" instead of "beta"

When I did the last exercise in lab 2 I just entered what is on the lab notes and this is what happened.
The exercise Part 5 was creating a sys_report directory to store in system information.

## Week 3

I have done lab week 3 System information commands and these are what I got. I screenshot the before and after, the before is when the system is on idle and the after is when I tried downloading something.

Unfortunately, my laptop do not have the capacity to install 2 VM and compare each others. 
I have install multiple times different VM and it keeps failling and does not open aor work, the only VM that I fortunately install succesfully is UBUNTU.

## Week 4

This week was the test pratice and coursework release, I mainly try to understand the lab test and did the exercise.

1. Create a System Architecture Diagram showing both system and network connections.
   - To be honest I was confused and went to Youtube to understand this further.
