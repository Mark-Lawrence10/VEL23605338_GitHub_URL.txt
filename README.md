GitHUB weekly progress for Operating System Module


This pages are proof of my process and evidence of what are my mistakes and how I overcome it, and what I have learned throughout the course.
It is also a documentation of the steps of my courseworks and what I have done steps by steps.

After downloading Ubuntu I tried the lab 1 notes to see what will show onto the VM.
These are some of the things it showed.


## Week 2
The lab week 2 was little confusing for me, I have to search why when I execute tree lab_test it doesnt work.
I found that I have to install "sudo apt install tree" and "sudo snap install tree" to be able to print the alpha,betta,gamma.
When I did that it worked, however I found myself into another problem when I run the next steps it shows that "cannot create regular file : not a directory". I double checked everything and I found the mistake I must have put the "betta" instead of "beta"

When I did the last exercise in lab 2 I just entered what is on the lab notes and this is what happened.
The exercise Part 5 was creating a sys_report directory to store in system information.

## Week 3

I have done lab week 3 System information commands and these are what I got. I screenshot the before and after, the before is when the system is on idle and the after is when I tried downloading something.

Unfortunately, my laptop do not have the capacity to install 2 VM and compare each others. 
I have install multiple times different VM and it keeps failling and does not open aor work, the only VM that I fortunately install succesfully is UBUNTU.

## Week 4

This week was the test pratice and coursework release, I mainly try to understand the lab test and did the exercise.

## Week 5
# PIPES AND REDIRECTION

   This task helped me understand how to output redirection and pipes work in linux. 
   I did have an idea however I am still learning it and trying to understand it better.

# FIFO

   This helped me understand how named pipes works, that it is wring to a FIFO wait until a reader is activated. 
   Maybe tha is why commans can appear to hang?

## Week 7
   
 TASK 1:1

   I learned the process states however it still confuses me and needed to work more in this particular subject.

 TASK 1:2
 
   This task helped me understand how Linux manages processes, including how they are created, controlled, and prioritised.
   I learned how to move processes between the foreground and background, monitor system resources, and safely terminate processes when needed.
   To improve, I need to become faster and more confident with process control commands and reduce small syntax mistakes by practising them more regularly.

  TASK 2:1

   Initially, the key generation failed due to a small syntax error where I typed ssh -keygen instead of ssh-keygen.
   Because of this, the key files were not created, and the public key could not be viewed.
   After correcting the command and rerunning it successfully, the key pair was generated as expected.

  TASK 2:3

   I made a small typing mistake when backing up the SSH configuration file by misspelling the filename.
   Although the backup was still created, the incorrect name could cause confusion when restoring the configuration later.

   TASK 3:1

   This task confused me, I did not understand why it does not work, I kept trying but did not figure it out.
   
![image alt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mark-Lawrence10/VEL23605338_GitHub_URL.txt/83975d2d2b9f2069fba861ba381996f97774e7d8/IMAGES/2025-12-17%20(15).png)

   TASK 3:2

   I created a non-root user called adminuser and set a strong password after weak passwords were rejected.
   The user was added to the sudo group and verified, following the principle of least privilege by avoiding direct use of the root account.

   TASK 3:3

   When I first attempted to run administrative commands remotely using SSH, the connection failed because I used server_ip as a placeholder instead of an actual IP address.
   Since this was not a valid hostname, SSH could not establish a connection and returned an error.
   Due to time constraints close to the deadline.
   I was unable to fully complete this step, but I understand that the correct approach is to replace the placeholder with the server’s real IP address.
