Week 2 was a little confusing for me at first. 
When I tried to run tree lab_test, it didn’t work because the tree command wasn’t installed on my system. 
I searched the error message and learned I had to install it first using sudo apt install tree (or sudo snap install tree). 
After installing it, tree worked and I could see the folder structure for alpha, beta, and gamma.

After that, I ran into another issue when copying my file.
The terminal showed: “cannot create regular file … Not a directory.” I double-checked my steps and realized the problem was a typo.
I accidentally created “betta” instead of “beta”.
Since the folder name didn’t match, the system couldn’t copy the file into the correct directory. 
Once I corrected the folder name, the copy command worked normally.

In the last part of Lab 2, I created a folder called sys_report to store system information. 
I used basic Linux commands to save details about the kernel, running processes, and memory usage into separate text files inside the folder. 
After that, I compressed the folder into a single archive file using tar. 
This task helped me get more comfortable using the command line to collect and organize system information.
