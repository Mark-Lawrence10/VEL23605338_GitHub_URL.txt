This is Performance comparisions of before and after.

Before I download anything the system was idle. 
CPU usage was low and most processing power is unused.
Memory was stable and only little disk activity.

During download the CPU activity increases, memory usage changed slightly.
I search why is memory decreases and it shows that Linux used available RAM to download data.
Disk activity also increases as it is downloading data.
